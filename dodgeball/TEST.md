1.) Can I add more people objects to the exisitng array arrOfPeople?
- Using the class Player, I should have a constructor that takes in all the object keys being used in arrOfPeople (name, age, skillSet, placeBorn)
    - This class should also have a function that allows us to push created person objects to the arrOfPeople array

2.) Can I add players to a team using the class constructor?
- Create a new class “Teammate” that extends to the Player class
- this class will have one additional attribute “team”
- Create a function that allows us to push this objects key name value to the given team array

3.) Are the people Object being added to the listOfPlayers array?
- When the button “Make Player” is clicked the associated person object should be pushed to the listOfPlayers array
- My array length should equal the number of Make Player button clicks

4.) Players who join a team (blue or red) added to their respective blueTeam or redTeam arrays?
- When the button “blue” is clicked the object’s key name value should be pushed into the approrpiate team color array
- The blueTeam array should equal the number of blue button clicks
- The redTeam array should equal the number of red button clicks
